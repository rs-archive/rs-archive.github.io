Dimension of the Damned was a temporary game mode for RS3. Unlike DarkScape, it was technically part of the main game. The game mode was 
accesed by clicking a link on the RuneScape website. It used world 200.

The map used by the event still exist in the RA3 game world. The models probably are as well but this is unconfirmed.
