DarkScape was a fork of RuneScape 3 source code. It used the build where the Tuska World Event went live as a base. While the events was removed, 
sprites of it could be seen in the cache.

The cache format was identical the one used by RS3 java caches. Its cache was only fully archived on release and the rest appear to be lost until proven otherwise.

DarkScape caches can be found on [OpenRS2](https://archive.openrs2.org/caches).
