Data that was not covered by RSCplus replays:

Missing Info:

Quick to get:
light fires in all banks & in zanaris
find fatigue value cutoffs for skilling (iron rock, coal rock, rune rock, etc...)
drink more zamorak brew (1) on different account builds. Only one instance recorded in RSC+ replays
do the OOB hack at the lumber yard & use it to walk to west ardougne & look upstairs in that one isolated house for scenery.
talk to leela with undyed wig during prince ali rescue quest
talking to squire at all points during knight's sword quest; check tickets if possible
create an ugthanki kebab
More Gnome Cooking & Cocktail Mixing would have been good, to gain more dialogues.
Baking just a pizza crust
Baking a pizza crust with tomato on it
drinking most of blurberry's cocktails
Talking to the Spirit of Scorpius with an unstrung unholy amulet (because talking to Brother Jered with unstrung holy amulet produces dialogue that you should string it)
Casting Charge air Orb, Charge fire Orb, and Charge water Orb on the wrong obelisk, or just on objects that aren't an obelisk in general (Got message for charge earth orb on air obelisk)
There's a wolf spawn south of the gate which is south of the Gnome Stronghold which I'm pretty sure I didn't get, but hopefully some one else got it in the past.
holding unstrung holy amulet and strung holy amulet at the same time and talking to brother Jered (suspect he would see strung holy amulet first)
holding a bear fur and grey wolf fur at the same time and talking to baraek
I think the spice merchants & other ardougne stalls didn't really get stolen from
bones to bananas should be tested more. Can you cast on bones on the ground?...

Not sure if we got:
gender change while wearing wrong gender armour?

Hard to get:
Enough PVP combat recorded from both sides that it is possible to determine PVP combat formula. Prayer effects etc.
Max hit with arrows (inc pvp). Beast Fable has 1 video on this where they kind of tried it, but Ranged Data in general is pretty scarce

but yea it boils down to combination of runescript content, description of how combat works (how does melee armour and ain+power influx) plus the distinct ranged weapons, skilling and from what I saw spawns since realistically not every npc spawn could be obtained(edited)

there's also an inaccessible house in West Ardougne which had ladder and unkown what was there
